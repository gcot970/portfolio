My motivation is to show off my skills as a potential asset to a future employer. It shows off all of the web applications that I have created previously while showing of skills while developing this webpage.

I learned how to align elements to the end of flexboxes, using IDs to have anchors point to certain parts of a webpage, and practice using hover over images.
